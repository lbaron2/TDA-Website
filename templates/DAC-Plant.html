    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project is to design, secure permits for, build, and operate a large-scale, sorbent-based, carbon capture system (CCS) pilot at a coal fired power generation facility. The project is organized into 4 distinct phases with go/no-go decision points between each phase. Over the course of the entire project, we plan to design (Phase 1), secure permits (Phase 2), build (Phase 3), and operate (Phase 4) a large-scale CCS pilot at the Wyoming Integrated Test Center (ITC) site located adjacent the Dry Fork Power Station located near Gillette, WY. The proposed large-scale CCS pilot system will separate carbon from a slipstream of the Dry Fork Station flue gas and validate the carbon capture efficiency at >90% (threshold) and >95% (objective) with a CO2 product purity > 95% under actual exhaust gas conditions. </p>
    <p>In Phase I, the only portion of the project current funded, TDA and its partners will complete a front-end engineering design (FEED) study for a commercial-scale, advanced carbon capture system capable of processing up to 23 MW (roughly 200,000 MTPY) net CO2 with 90+% carbon capture efficiency and 95+% CO2 purity. The host site, the Wyoming ITC, is situated adjacent to Basin Electric’s Dry Fork Station power generating facility. Dry Fork Station is a coal-fired power plant rated at roughly 405 MW (net) that currently releases roughly 2.7 million MTPY of CO2. In later project phases, we plan to pursue permitting, construct, and test the pilot-scale CCS unit at Wyoming ITC’s large test bay. The test bay has been designed and constructed specifically to facilitate large-scale demonstrations up to roughly the 23 MWe scale.

    <h3>CBP Summary</h3>
    <p>TDA is strongly committed to community engagement and community benefits and will work with the University of Wyoming’s (UW) School of Energy Resources (SER) to ensure the project benefits the community. SER is committed to cultivating relationships with key stakeholders to increase collaborative engagement with historically underserved stakeholder groups. Our goal is to create a two-way conversation with local stakeholders including neighboring communities, labor unions and workforce organizations. TDA is dedicated to attracting and maintaining a skilled and well-qualified workforce for the design, construction and operation of the carbon capture pilot plant. In addition, we will employ and mentor college and high school interns, hold seminars at local schools, and support early-career underrepresented engineers and scientists so that we can increase the number of underrepresented STEM candidates (women, minorities, etc.) available in the labor pool. Finally, we want to ensure that benefits of federal investments flow to local or disadvantaged communities and that no environmental impact should negatively affect the local or any disadvantaged community. </p>

          <p>Ensure project construction and operations jobs are of sufficient quality to attract and retain a skilled workforce to deal with construction and operations staffing and workforce requirements. We will use the list of jobs developed in the technical project to determine the required education or training needed for these jobs. In addition, we will determine the types and level of investment needed for workforce education and training by comparing the existing workforce (particularly local residents, dislocated workers/workers from energy or industrial sectors, or workers from disadvantaged communities and populations) to needed workforce requirements</p>
