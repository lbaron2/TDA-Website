      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>The point of this project is to separate oxygen from ambient temperature air to support low cost hydrogen
        production from the gasification of biomass and/or wastes. You can find more info <a
          href="https://www.netl.doe.gov/project-information?p=FE0032328">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>CBP Specifics</h3>
      <p>TDA participates in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Phase II SBIR/STTR Diversity Supplement program that aims
        to increase the diversity in the SBIR programs’ participants. The purpose of this program is to improve the
        diversity of the research workforce by recruiting and supporting undergraduate and graduate students from groups
        that have been shown to be underrepresented in federal SBIR/STTR research programs. As part of this program TDA
        has hired a mechanical engineering intern for the summer of 2022 from an ethnic group that is underrepresented
        in the scientific workforce.</p>

                  <p>We contacted 2 STEM teachers at Arvada West by email and began corresponding with Serrano Elsa, the STEM teacher at Arvada West.  We initially planned that she would bring 100 students to visit TDA in early April but due to scheduling difficulties we have delayed these seminars to September.</p>
