      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>The goal of the project is to make a manufacturing method for an already existing part that acts as a Direct
        Air
        capture device, but with additive manufacturing. The part will capture C02 through a rapid thermal swing
        adsorption (RTSA). It uses a dual head extruder, to swap materials layer by layer. You can find more info <a
          href="https://www.netl.doe.gov/project-information?p=FE0032260">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>CBP Specifics</h3>
      <p>TDA participates in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Phase II SBIR/STTR Diversity Supplement program that aims
        to increase the diversity in the SBIR programs’ participants. The purpose of this program is to improve the
        diversity of the research workforce by recruiting and supporting undergraduate and graduate students from groups
        that have been shown to be underrepresented in federal SBIR/STTR research programs. As part of this program TDA
        has hired a mechanical engineering intern for the summer of 2022 from an ethnic group that is underrepresented
        in the scientific workforce.</p>

            with people of many nationalities and backgrounds working together and sharing common objectives. SLB does
            not have a 'nationality' that describes its culture but operates in a truly global manner throughout the
            world. SLB recruits and develops people in alignment with their business objectives and the countries in

                  <p>We contacted 2 STEM teachers at Arvada West by email and began corresponding with Serrano Elsa, the STEM teacher at Arvada West.
