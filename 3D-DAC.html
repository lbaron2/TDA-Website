      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>The goal of the project is to develop novel 3D-printed sorbent structures that can capture carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from air via a rapid thermal swing adsorption (RTSA) process.   You can find more info <a
          href="https://www.netl.doe.gov/project-information?p=FE0032260">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>CBP Summary</h3>
      <p>In this project, our CBP goal is to increase diversity, equity, inclusion and accessability (DEIA) at TDA and in the workforce. 
        As part of this program, we will employ and mentor college and highschool interns, hold seminars at local schools, and support early-career underrepresented engineers and scientists.

            not have a 'nationality' that describes its culture but operates in a truly global manner throughout the
            world. SLB recruits and develops people in alignment with their business objectives and the countries in

                  <p>We contacted 2 STEM teachers at Arvada West by email and began corresponding with Serrano Elsa, the STEM teacher at Arvada West.  We initially planned that she would bring 100 students to visit TDA in early April but due to scheduling difficulties we have delayed these seminars to September.</p>
