      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>The goal of the project is to develop novel 3D-printed sorbent structures that can capture carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from air via a rapid thermal swing adsorption (RTSA) process.   You can find more info <a
          href="https://www.netl.doe.gov/project-information?p=FE0032260">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>CBP Summary</h3>
      <p>In this project, our CBP goal is to increase diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) at TDA and in the workforce. 
        As part of this program, we will employ and mentor college and high school interns, hold seminars at local schools, and support early-career underrepresented engineers and scientists.

                  <p>For the Summer Engineering Intern position last year, Table 1 shows the diversity of the applicant pool.  The Summer Engineering Intern applicant pool was 54% minority and 25% female with 0 veterans and 2 people who self-identified with a disability.  This year we had 183 applicants so the applicant pool was much larger.  However, the percentage of Hispanic/Latino applicants only increased 0.27% in 2024 compared to 2023.  We expected a larger increase in Hispanic/Latino applicants since 6.01% of the applicants applied from the SHPE website (Table 2).</p>

                  <p>We selected Arvada West High School in nearby Arvada which is located in a disadvantaged community.  The community is disadvantaged due to low income, traffic proximity and volume, proximity to a superfund site, wastewater discharge and lack of high school education.</p>
                  <p>We contacted 2 STEM teachers at Arvada West by email and began corresponding with Serrano Elsa, the STEM teacher at Arvada West.  We initially planned that she would bring 100 students to visit TDA in early April but due to scheduling difficulties we have delayed these seminars to September.</p>
