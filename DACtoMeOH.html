      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <p>The goal of this project is for TDA Research, in collaboration with Verde Clean Fuels, SLB, and the University of Colorado Denver (UCD), to complete a conceptual design study for an integrated direct air capture and carbon dioxide utilization system (DACUS) that captures and utilizes carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in an integrated methanol (MeOH) synthesis unit.

        find more info <a href="https://www.netl.doe.gov/project-information?p=FE0032400">here</a>.</p>
      <h3>Justice 40 Summary</h3>
      <p>The Justice 40 initiative is a federal initiative that gives 40% of the benefits of federal investments to
        disadvantaged communities. You can find more info <a

      <h3>CBP Summary</h3>
      <p>TDA participates in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Phase II SBIR/STTR Diversity Supplement program that aims
        to increase the diversity in the SBIR programs’ participants. The purpose of this program is to improve the
        diversity of the research workforce by recruiting and supporting undergraduate and graduate students from groups
        that have been shown to be underrepresented in federal SBIR/STTR research programs. As part of this program TDA
        has hired a mechanical engineering intern for the summer of 2022 from an ethnic group that is underrepresented
        in the scientific workforce.</p>

          <p class="partner-des">SLB is advancing their New Energy portfolio, which consists of new businesses in
            low-carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies; they announced a commitment to be net zero by 2050. They
            are building partnerships to help other industries reduce their emissions. Decarbonization across the
            industry includes reducing emissions from oil and gas operations, electrification of infrastructure and
            reducing or eliminating flaring.</p>

          <p class="partner-des">Verde is dedicated to producing green transportation fuels (initially from waste- and
            bio-based syngas production). Their STG+ technology turns renewable feedstocks into finished drop-in fuel
            that requires no additional refining. In addition, they have a technology that reduces gas flaring by
            turning natural gas and flare gas into liquid fuels. They have experience with assessing the project impacts
            on the community and adverse effects on human beings. This includes identifying significant effects of the
            project and mitigating or avoiding these effects where feasible.</p>
