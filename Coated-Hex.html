                    <p>For the Summer Engineering Intern position last year, Table 1 shows the diversity of the applicant pool.  The Summer Engineering Intern applicant pool was 54% minority and 25% female with 0 veterans and 2 people who self-identified with a disability.  This year we had 183 applicants so the applicant pool was much larger.  However, the percentage of Hispanic/Latino applicants only increased 0.27% in 2024 compared to 2023.  We expected a larger increase in Hispanic/Latino applicants since 6.01% of the applicants applied from the SHPE website (Table 2).</p>

                  <p>We contacted 2 STEM teachers at Arvada West by email and began corresponding with Serrano Elsa, the STEM teacher at Arvada West.  We initially planned that she would bring 100 students to visit TDA in early April but due to scheduling difficulties we have delayed these seminars to September.</p>
