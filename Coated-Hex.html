          <h3>Project Description</h3>
          <p>The goal of this project is to take a commercially available tube-in-place heat exchanger and convert it to a contactor for DACs. You can find more info <a href = "https://www.netl.doe.gov/project-information?p=FE0032261">here</a>.</p>
          <h3>CBP Specifics</h3>
          <p>TDA participates in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Phase II SBIR/STTR Diversity Supplement program that aims to increase the diversity in the SBIR programs’ participants. The purpose of this program is to improve the diversity of the research workforce by recruiting and supporting undergraduate and graduate students from groups that have been shown to be underrepresented in federal SBIR/STTR research programs. As part of this program TDA has hired a mechanical engineering intern for the summer of 2022 from an ethnic group that is underrepresented in the scientific workforce.</p>

                  <p>We contacted 2 STEM teachers at Arvada West by email and began corresponding with Serrano Elsa, the STEM teacher at Arvada West.  We initially planned that she would bring 100 students to visit TDA in early April but due to scheduling difficulties we have delayed these seminars to September.</p>
